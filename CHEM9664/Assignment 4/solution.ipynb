This aligns extremely well with the value determined from the TIP4P simulation. The differences come from the charge distribution used to simulate water. It is clear that in the charge distribution representation of SPC (point charge model) and TIP5P (using a 5 point charge model) are not as good as modeling water at this temperature. \n",
